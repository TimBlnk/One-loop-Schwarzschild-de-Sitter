# One-loop-Schwarzschild-de-Sitter
This repository contains PDFs detailing my calculations and research performed as part of a research collaboration with Dr. Jan Pieter van der Schaar at the University of Amsterdam.

The goal is to compute the full one-loop quantum-corrected partition function of the Schwarzschildâ€“de Sitter spacetime, based on my master's thesis and [arXiv:2203.06155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06155).
