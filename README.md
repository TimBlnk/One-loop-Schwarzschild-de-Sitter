# One-loop Schwarzschild-de-Sitter
This repository contains PDFs detailing my calculations and research performed as part of a research collaboration with Dr. Jan Pieter van der Schaar at the University of Amsterdam.

The goal is to compute the full one-loop quantum-corrected partition function of the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime, based on my master's thesis and [arXiv:2203.06155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06155). You can read my master's thesis for an introduction to the constrained instanton formalism, which this work uses to calculate the one-loop quantum corrections, and an explanation why Schwarzschild-de Sitter has to be viewed as a constrained instanton. The original paper on constrained instantons in gravity can be found here: [arXiv:2010.02241](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02241).

## Contents
- `one-loop-sds-proposal.pdf` – I show that a proposal that the second-order variation of the constraint functional can be discarded is incorrect.
- `one-loop-sds-gauge-dependency.pdf` – I sketch that the area constraint functional likely leads to a gauge dependency in the one-loop partition function.
- `no-gauge-dependency-from-covariant-constraints.pdf` – I show that including a covariant constraint functional in the Nariai and de Sitter partition function does not lead to a gauge dependency. This suggests that covariant constraint functionals do not lead to gauge dependencies.
- `sds-zero-mode-volume.pdf` – Under the assumption that only the Killing vectors contribute to the zero mode volume, I calculate the zero mode volume of Schwarzschild-de Sitter. I find it does not interpolate between the de Sitter and Nariai zero mode volume.
- `sds-scalar-spectrum.pdf` - I obtain a semiclassical analytic expression for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter scalar modes.
